<h1>Our review on how accessible our website is </h1>

<p>
    After being properly finished with designing and coding our webpage and 
    webtools we had to ensure whether or not our page was accessible. International 
    web standards express that even one with disabilities should be able to navigate easily
     through your website.  Accessibility is essential for both organizations and developers and 
     its requirement is there to benefit the individual-user, the business and the society. 

<br>
<br>

For our accessibility check, we used WebAim: https://webaim.org/.

<div style="width: 100%; text-align: center;" class="picLeft">
  
    <img style="width: auto;"
    class="articleImg"
    src="img/webaim.png"
    alt="WebAim front page"
    
    />
    
        
</div>

<h2>This is our review regarding following key points:</h2>
<br>

<p>Regarding perceiving and navigation through our page we found out that: 
    <br>
    
    
    One thing to be sure of is that our website has room for being more accessible. 
    Although we have ensured that all images have a text alternative available we do not have 
    any specific function that makes it easier for one with wither visual, aufitory, 
    motor or cognitive disabilities  
     <br>
    
    This section is important as one should ensure that the page is accessible on different tablets of different sizes. 
    
    
    After our test we found out that: 
    
     
    
    Do we have different input modes? Is it accssesible through smart phones, smart watches, smart TVs and other devices with various screen sizes? 
    
     
    
     
    
     
    
     
    
    Regarding whether or not our page is accessible for one with disabilities we found out that: 
    
     
    
    No auditory, cognitive, neurological or physical speech that reads the different sections of our page, but as to visual and simplicity the page is rather easy to navigate. 
    
     
    
     
    
     
    
    Regarding whether or not our page is accessible for people with changing abilities to ageing? 
    
     
    
     
    
    Is our page for people with “temporary disabilities” such as a broken arm or lost glasses? 
    
     
    
    Is our website accessible for people with situational imitations such as bright sunlight or a being in an environment where one cannot listen to audio. 
    
    
    
    Is our page accessible for people with slow internet connection?
